Steps to make this widget work in your own website
1.  Before using this code make your target website's colors all be dependent on CSS :root vars.
    [:root vars tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)
    you might have to change your icons to webkit masks of a png over a div so you can change their color with css rather then a new image.

2.  From themeChanger.html take the div with id="themeContainer" and put it wherever you want the theme changer on your website
3.  Link the script right before the end of the body element in all documents that will use the theme changer
4.  Link the styles located in theme.css to all documents that will use the theme changer or copy and paste the styles into your own existing style document
5.  Make sure to style the theme changer to work where you put it in your website. 
    Styling and display work has intententionally been left out of this document so you can style it yourself.
